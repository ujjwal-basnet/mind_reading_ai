The model jumped directly to a highly specific guess (\"Is he known for playing the character Ant-Man?\") without asking any preliminary, broad questions to gather information. A successful guessing strategy involves starting with general questions (e.g., \"Is the celebrity male or female?\", \"Are they an actor?\", \"Are they primarily known for movies or TV?\") to narrow down the possibilities. Without any context or previous turns, making such a specific character-based guess is essentially a random shot in the dark and has a very low probability of success.
